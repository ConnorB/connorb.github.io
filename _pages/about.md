I completed my undergraduate degree in Natural Resource Management with a concentration in Fisheries and Aquatic Biology at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, TX. While at TTU, I worked with [Dr. Allison Pease](https://cafnr.missouri.edu/person/allison-pease/) and [Dr. Kelbi Delaune](https://twitter.com/Aquatic_Kel) on the Pecos River studying macroinvertebrate communities.

After finishing undergrad, I moved to Huntsville, TX to pursue a Masters of Science in Biology at Sam Houston State University. During my M.Sc., I worked with [Dr. Amber Ulseth](https://www.ulsethlab.com/) on linking changes in land use and precipitation to stream ecosystem metabolism in sub-tropical Texas coastal streams.

After my time at SHSU, I knew I wanted to continue my research on ecosystem metabolism, so I joined [Dr. Erin Seyboldâ€™s](http://www.erinseybold.com/) lab at the [Kansas Geological Survey](https://www.kgs.ku.edu/) as a Ph.D. student for the Aquatic Intermittency effects on Microbiomes in Streams (AIMS) project, working on quantifying the metabolic regimes of intermittent streams.
