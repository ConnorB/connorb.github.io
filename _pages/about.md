I'm an aquatic ecosystem ecologist. My research interest include understanding how abiotic and biotic drivers effect stream ecosystems. My current research focuses on characterizing intermittent stream metabolism, while my previous work focused on how changes in land use along a precipitation gradients effect ecosystem metabolism of Texas coastal streams.
