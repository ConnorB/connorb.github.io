I'm an aquatic ecosystem ecologist. My research interest include understanding how abiotic and biotic drivers effect stream ecosystems.

My current research focuses on characterizing intermittent stream metabolism, previously, I focused on how changes in land use and precipitation gradients effect ecosystem metabolism of Texas coastal streams.
